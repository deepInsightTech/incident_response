Author: Mahesh, [mahi22](https://github.com/mahi22) ðŸ‘‹

Revision 1, Released 1 Nov 2020

The plan was developed by the team at [Deep Insight Tech](https://deepinsight.tech/), to help the organization to respond effectively, minimize cost and impact, and get back to business as soon as possible.

# Assess

1. **Stay calm and professional.**
2. Gather pertinent information, _e.g._, alarms, events, data, assumptions, intutions (**observe**).
3. Consider impact categories, below (**orient**), and determine if there is a possible incident (**decide**):
   1. Initiate a response if there is an incident (**act**). If in doubt, initiate a response. The incident commander and response team can adjust upon investigation and review.


# USAGE

Build using the new Foam Workspace !

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

 *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, "open workspace" refers to [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).*

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)

After setting up the repository, open [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) and edit, add or remove any settings you'd like for your Foam workspace.

To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.
